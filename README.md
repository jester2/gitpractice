# gitpractice
A repository to practice pulls, commits, branching, and merging.

I needed a way to practice my git skills without mucking up a production repository, so this is how I will do it.

# Assumptions
- I came from a background in CVS, so I assumed that commits and merges basically occured on one central server.  I didn't know a user can have his own repository, and then was able to merge to a repo remotely on a central server
- I am hesitant to commit changes on top of someone else's well-established code.  This is a workflow and education issue.
- I should be using branching more.  For every feature, I should create a branch.
- I should be commiting more.  For every change, I should do a commit. (However, should I do it for an individual change, or up to a working state?)
- How much do I need to know about what other people are working on?  
- What is staging?  How is that different between commiting and merging a project to the mainline repository?
